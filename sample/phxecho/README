This is not a real server. just to tell you how to use phxpaxos.

The echo command will replicate to other echo_server by phxpaxos.

The suggest start shell write on echo.sh. you can run three echo_server to test phxpaxos.

First, you need to create a new directory names "log" as the subdirectory of the directory where your shell running. 

Echo_server will create a workspace dir on ./logpath_ip_port, data generate by phxpaxos will write on this path.

Have fun :).
