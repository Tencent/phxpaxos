PhxPaxos-Specific Installation Notes
====================================

*** NOTE FOR 64-BIT LINUX SYSTEMS

The PhxPaxos library has to be built on 64-bit systems or you may
experience some problems.

Basic Installation
==================

Briefly, the shell commands `sh autoinstall.sh; make;' should configure 
and build this package. The following more-detailed instructions are 
generic; see the `README' file for instructions specific to this package.

   The `autoinstall.sh' shell script attempts to guess correct values 
for various system-dependent variables used during compilation. It 
uses those values and Makefile.define in each directory which describes 
the source files infomation to create a `Makefile' in each directory of 
the package. 

   The file `makefile.mk' is used to set options of the compilation 
environment. You need modify it if you want to change the options including
the paths of the third party libraries, like glog, leveldb, and protobuf.

   The grpc library is required if you want to complile the example 
source.

The simplest way to compile this package is:
  1. Make sure the third party libraries, protobuf (3.0 or above) and 
  leveldb, have been installed in the system. If you want to test the 
  samples, libraries of glog and grpc are also required.

  2. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `sh autoinstall.sh' to configure the package for your system.

  3. Type `make' to compile the package.

  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
  documentation.

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the source 
  code directory by typing `make clean'.  

Compilers and Options
=====================

Glibc 2.12 or above, as well as 64bit option and C++ 11 support in compiler,
is required to build the library.

If you want to include more options, modifying the makefile.mk file in 
the source code directory is a good idea.

Installation Position--------------TODO
=====================

Libraries are under ./lib and include files are under ./include, related to 
the local source code directory.

Installation Names
==================

By default, `make install' installs the package's commands under
`./lib', include files under `./include', etc.  You
can specify an installation prefix by giving `autointall.sh' the option 
`--prefix=PREFIX'.

Installation Plugin 
==============

Usage of Plugin can be found in plugin directory 

The simplest way to compile this plugin is:

  1. `cd plugin' to the plugin directory containing the plugin library's 
  source code.

  2. Type `make' to compile the plugin.

  3. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
  documentation.

  4. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the source 
  code directory by typing `make clean'.
